What is BrightNet?
------------------

A Tor based P2P network library for messaging (if peer is offline it uses a kind of mailbox) and storage.
It uses Tor Hidden Services and a flooding network.  

The code base is forked from the P2P network used in Bitsquare but is open for a complete rewrite to a general 
purpose library. 
It is not intended to keep Bitsquare synced with BrightNet, but Bitsquare will use BrightNet once it is further developed, tested and mature.
